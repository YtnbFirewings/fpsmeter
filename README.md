This uses code from [Veency](http://gitweb.saurik.com/veency.git) which is under the [GNU AGPL](http://gitweb.saurik.com/veency.git/blob/HEAD:/COPYING), so follow that license

It also uses code from a file in another project, so follow that license too if it has one (idk): https://github.com/danielooi/anthrax/blob/master/rdkit/framebuffer.c

Everything else is licensed under the one that lets you do whatever you want, including you being able to sue me if it breaks your phone or kills your family. I love going to court.
